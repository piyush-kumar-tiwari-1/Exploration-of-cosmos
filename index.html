                <h2>Planets</h2>
                <p>- Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars.
                    - Our Solar System has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
                    - Planets vary in size, composition, and distance from their star.
                    - "Terrestrial planets" (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are rocky.
                    - "Gas giants" (Jupiter, Saturn) are made of hydrogen and helium.
                    - "Ice giants" (Uranus, Neptune) have icy compositions.
                    - Many planets have moons, rings, and atmospheres.
                    - Planetary science studies the formation and characteristics of planets.
                    - Planets help us understand the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

                <h2>Galaxies</h2>
                <p>- A galaxy is a massive system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.
                    - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System.
                    - Galaxies can vary in size, shape, and number of stars (from millions to trillions).
                    - They are classified into types: spiral, elliptical, and irregular.
                    - Our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy.
                    - Galaxies are often found in clusters, groups, or superclusters.
                    - The universe contains billions of galaxies, each with its own unique characteristics.
                    - Galaxies evolve over time through processes like star formation and mergers.
                    - Studying galaxies helps understand the origins and structure of the universe.</p>

                <h2>The Universe</h2>
                <p>- The universe is the totality of space, time, matter, and energy.
                    - It contains everything: stars, planets, galaxies, dark matter, and dark energy.
                    - The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years across.
                    - The Big Bang theory explains the universe's origin, starting from a singularity around 13.8 billion years ago.
                    - The universe is expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other.
                    - It consists of billions of galaxies, each containing billions of stars.
                    - Dark energy makes up about 68% of the universe, while dark matter accounts for 27%.
                    - The universe's ultimate fate is still uncertain, with theories like heat death or the Big Crunch.</p>

                <h2>Stars</h2>
                <p>- Stars are luminous celestial bodies composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.
                    - They generate energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium.
                    - Stars vary in size, temperature, and brightness, classified into spectral types (e.g., O, B, A, G, etc.).
                    - Our Sun is a medium-sized, yellow dwarf star.
                    - Stars are born in nebulae, live for millions to billions of years, and die as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.
                    - Studying stars helps understand the universe's formation and evolution.</p>
